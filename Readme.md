# MCTS - Draughts
Yet an other school project, using Java this time. And as we don't care about IG it's going to be a console game.
## Basics
A game of draughts [as basically defined by Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts).
We're supposed to make it using parallel computing. It'll be implemented after a first version of the game with some basic MCTS algorithm runs.

*N.B. :
You can choose the size of your board at the start of the game, it goes from 5 to infinity.
As it seems impossible to play with a board smaller than 5x5*

## IA
We're implementing the MCTS (Monte Carlo tree search) algorithm as an IA for the players

## Launch
As it's an ongoing project, no executables has been generated yet, so if you want to launch it you'll have to use an IDE
